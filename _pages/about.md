<p style="text-align: justify;">
Machine learning is becoming an integral component of sociotechnical
systems. Predictions are used to grant beneficial resources or
withhold opportunities, and the consequences of such decisions induce complex
social dynamics by changing agent outcomes and prompting individuals to
proactively respond to decision rules. This introduces challenges for standard
machine learning methodology. Static measurements and training sets poorly
capture the complexity of dynamic interactions between algorithms and humans.
Strategic adaptation to decision rules can render statistical regularities
obsolete. Correlations momentarily observed in data may not be robust enough to
support interventions for long-term welfare. <br><br>

Recognizing the limits of traditional, static approaches to decision-making,
researchers in fields ranging from public policy to computer science to
economics have recently begun to view consequential decision-making through a
dynamic lens. This workshop will confront the use of machine learning to make
consequential decisions in dynamic environments.
